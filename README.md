# java_rule_engine

## FIRST

The project provides the rule mapping service.

What is rule mapping service? 

In my view, the service can calculate some results (such as the discount, warranty period etc.) by some rules that merchant hava set.

Why I do the work?

Because my company needs some support about this aspect. So I searched many information on the net,  did it myself.

it's my little process and I'm willing to share it with you.

## SECOND

The project is based maven, Spring Boot framework, with the MariaDB (same as MysqlDB)

The design about databse is shown below.

## THIRD

To be honest, there is some limitations in my project, such as the low expansibility. But it will be nice if your business scenario is simle or just for testing.

Now I'm in the reconstitution, and it will be very soon to push my next version.
